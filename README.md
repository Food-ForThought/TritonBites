## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]
This app will allow for UCSD Students to rate food around San Diego as well as upload pictures.
### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:Lifestyle/social/informational**
- **Mobile: at UCSD, people order food on a mobile app, we are trying to improve the experience by allowing people to see detailed reviews and get live feedback**
- **Story: first app to do such a thing**
- **Market: relevant to essentially every ucsd student and possibly even faculty**
- **Habit: not addictive but it is habit forming, could be integrated to people's daily routine**
- **Scope: there is a lot of potential for further work and functionality but the current idea and required stories are still quite valuable. Quite clearly defined goals but lot of potential for future work**
